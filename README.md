# Empowering Faith – Capstone Project 🌐  

This was my final year **capstone project**, a full website designed and built on **Wix Studio**.  
The goal of *Empowering Faith* was to create an accessible platform where people can learn about the mission, explore resources, and support the community.  

It combines thoughtful design with functionality, including sections for information, engagement, and future features like donations and live AI chat.
